いつかは捨てるtrust＆stream 仮の希望像
完全なClose 高架線ごと
取り替えてるような怒りと業
Woh oh oh oh oh oh oh
機械的感情に飽きてるLIFE
Woh oh oh oh oh oh oh
人の所為じゃ つまらない

Go steam ahead with your soul
And scream it out
A gleam in your fervid eye
There ain't no doubt
Shoot 'em off
What you holdin' on for?
You're not an underdog
Keep findin' your way
Boost 'em up
What you holdin' on for?
Let's get out of control
Keep burnin' your flame
Your icy heart pumps hot blood to your marrow,
Though
They're gettin' close to what you got
Pursuin' and takin' all wherever you go
Woh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Your life's so breakable, I can't tell a lie
Woh oh oh oh oh oh oh
To stand tall through, just mar the night
*Repeat
